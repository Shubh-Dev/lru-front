# lru-Frontend

This is a React Applicatiom that consumes the LRU Cache API. The LRU Cache is implemented in Go using the Fiber framework. The LRU Cache is a data structure that can store a fixed number of items and evicts the least recently used item when the cache is full. The LRU Cache has the following operations:

- `get(key)`: Get the value of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
- `set(key, value)`: Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.
